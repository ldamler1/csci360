<P>This assignment is practice in reading a dump and diagnosing an error.

<P>Write out your answers to these problems in a text file and submit 
   them by the due date.

<P>Show your work!

<P><HR>

<P>Run the following program.  You can use the JCL we used in
   the lab training exercise.
    
<PRE>WRITTEN2 CSECT
         USING WRITTEN2,15  ESTABLISH A BASE REGISTER 
         L     3,FIRST      LOAD A NUMBER INTO REGISTER 3
         L     4,SECOND     LOAD ANOTHER NUMBER INTO REGISTER 4 
         AR    3,4          ADD THE TWO NUMBERS 
         LA    5,THIRD      REGISTER 5 WILL = ADDRESS OF THIRD
         L     6,TWO        PUT TWO'S VALUE IN REGISTER 6
         ST    3,0(6,5)     STORE THE RESULT
         XDUMP THIRD,4      DUMP THE RESULT
         SR    6,6          SET REGISTER 6 to 0
         BCR   B'1111',14   RETURN TO CALLER 
* THIS IS A COMMENT LINE.
NOTE     DC    CL2'OK'      PLACE KEEPER
TWO      DC    F'2'         A CONSTANT = 2
FIRST    DC    F'211'       A NUMBER
SECOND   DC    F'94'        ANOTHER NUMBER 
THIRD    DS    XL4          SUM OF THE TWO NUMBERS 
FOURTH   DS    F            YET ANOTHER NUMBER
         END   WRITTEN2     PROGRAM ENDS HERE</PRE>

<P>Use the resulting output to answer the following questions: 

<OL>
  <LI>(2 points) Did this error occur (a) while the program was being
      assembled or (b) when it was being run?
      <P>
  <LI>(2 points) What is the address of the next instruction which
      will be executed?
      <P>
  <LI>(2 points) What is the value of the condition code at the time
      of the ABEND?
      <P>
  <LI>(2 points) What is the length of the instruction that caused
      the ABEND (a number of bytes)?
      <P>
  <LI>(2 points) What is the address of the instruction that caused
      the abend?
      <P>
  <LI>(2 points) What type of error occurred (number and name)?
      <P>
  <LI>(2 points) What actually causes this error?
      <P>
  <LI>(3 points) Correct the error by rewriting the section of code
      that caused it.  (The sum should be stored in THIRD.)  (There
      are several correct ways to do this.)
      <P>
  <LI>(2 points) At the time of the ABEND, what is the value of
      register 3 in decimal?
      <P>
  <LI>(2 points) What does the value in register 3 represent at the
      time of the ABEND?
      <P>
  <LI>(3 points) Why is the address (LOC column) of the storage area
      with the label TWO on it at X'000024' when the DC statement
      whose address is X'000020' only takes up 2 bytes?
      <P>
  <LI>(2 points) What are the contents of the two bytes of user
      storage starting at address X'000022'?  What do they represent?
      <P>
  <LI>(1 point)  Why do we not have XDUMP output?
      <P>
  <LI>(2 points) How many bytes are taken up by the XDUMP
       pseudo-instruction?
      <P>
  <LI>(1 point) If we correct the error, what should be the value of
      the condition code at the end of the program (when we reach
      the BCR line)?
</OL>
